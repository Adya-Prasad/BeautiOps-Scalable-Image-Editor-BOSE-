### Explanation:
1. **Directory Structure:** Defines a clean structure for the frontend, backend, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins configuration.
2. **Phases:** Outlines each phase of development from initial setup to testing and scaling, providing step-by-step guidance on implementation.
3. **CI/CD:** Shows how to automate builds and deployments using Jenkins.
4. **Scaling & Monitoring:** Briefly discusses how to scale using Kubernetes and monitor with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK.

This concise roadmap is ready for you to add to your **README.md** and start working on your project!

1. Frontend (HTML)
  * A file upload form and filter options.
  * A preview and download button for the processed image.

2. Backend (Python Flask API):

    * Handle image processing using libraries like Pillow (PIL) or OpenCV.
    * Provide endpoints for uploading, processing, and downloading images.

3. Containerization (Docker):

  * Dockerize both the frontend and backend.

4. Orchestration (Kubernetes):

    * Deploy the frontend and backend as separate services.

5. CI/CD (Jenkins):

    * Automate Docker builds and Kubernetes deployments.
