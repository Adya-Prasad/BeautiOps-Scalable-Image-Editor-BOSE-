1. Frontend (HTML)
  * A file upload form and filter options.
  * A preview and download button for the processed image.

2. Backend (Python Flask API):

    * Handle image processing using libraries like Pillow (PIL) or OpenCV.
    * Provide endpoints for uploading, processing, and downloading images.

3. Containerization (Docker):

  * Dockerize both the frontend and backend.

4. Orchestration (Kubernetes):

    * Deploy the frontend and backend as separate services.

5. CI/CD (Jenkins):

    * Automate Docker builds and Kubernetes deployments.

A simple image beautifier project is an excellent choice for beginners! Here's a straightforward idea you can build while leveraging your DevOps stack:
Project Idea: Image Beautifier Service
Objective

Create a small application where users can:

    Upload an image.
    Apply basic beautification filters (like grayscale, brightness adjustment, or sharpening).
    Download the enhanced image.
    Deploy using Docker and Kubernetes.
    Automate updates using Jenkins.

Why This Idea?

    Beginner-Friendly: Simple image transformations can be done with Python libraries like PIL or OpenCV.
    Creative and Fun: Visual results make the project engaging and easy to demonstrate.
    Practical Use: Many users need quick edits without complex tools like Photoshop.

Tech Stack Overview

    Frontend (HTML):
        A file upload form and filter options.
        A preview and download button for the processed image.

    Backend (Python Flask API):
        Handle image processing using libraries like Pillow (PIL) or OpenCV.
        Provide endpoints for uploading, processing, and downloading images.

    Containerization (Docker):
        Dockerize both the frontend and backend.

    Orchestration (Kubernetes):
        Deploy the frontend and backend as separate services.

    CI/CD (Jenkins):
        Automate Docker builds and Kubernetes deployments.

Project Features

    Frontend:
        File upload form.
        Filter options (e.g., Grayscale, Brightness, Sharpen).
        A "Beautify" button to process the image.
        A download link for the enhanced image.

    Backend:
        Endpoints:
            POST /upload: Accept an image for processing.
            POST /beautify: Apply the selected filter(s).
            GET /download: Return the beautified image.
        Filters:
            Grayscale
            Brightness Adjustment
            Sharpen
            Contrast Boost

    Docker:
        Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend.
        Test locally using docker-compose.

    Kubernetes:
        Deploy the app using Kubernetes with YAML files for Deployment, Service, and Ingress.
        Expose the service to users.

    CI/CD (Jenkins):
        Automate:
            Testing backend functionality (e.g., file uploads).
            Building Docker images.
            Kubernetes deployment.

Steps to Build

    Backend (Flask):
        Set up endpoints for uploading and processing images.
        Use Pillow (PIL) for:
            Grayscale: Image.convert("L")
            Brightness: ImageEnhance.Brightness(img).enhance(factor)
            Sharpen: ImageFilter.SHARPEN

    Frontend (HTML):
        Create a form for file uploads.
        Add filter selection (checkboxes or a dropdown).
        Add a "Preview" section for the processed image.

    Containerization (Docker):
        Write Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
        Use docker-compose for local testing.

    Deploy on Kubernetes:
        Write YAML files for frontend and backend Deployment and Service.
        Use Kubernetes Ingress for service exposure.

    Automate with Jenkins:
        Automate:
            Building and pushing Docker images.
            Deploying updates to Kubernetes.
